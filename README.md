# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-MRI-Images
The idea is to build a model which takes MRI images as an input and by applying various Data Mining Techniques it identifies whether the tumor is present or not.

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
<br>
Brain tumors are the most widely recognized and dangerous type of tumors. A brain tumor is a mass, of abnormal cells in the brain. The effects of brain tumors depend upon the area and size of the tumor. It is exceptionally vital to recognize the tumor as soon as possible. MRI can be utilized to distinguish the cancer by examining the MRI yet this technique is extremely tedious for a large number of cases.

<b><u>PSEUDOCODE</u></b>
<br>
1. Upload your dataset or some images in MATLAB for tumor detection.
<br>
2. Input images one by one to check if tumor is present or not. To do this do the following: 
<br>
3. First, filter your images by giving certain values in the pre-defined function an iso diff_function ().
<br>
4. The image data is filtered and all kinds of noise is removed from the image.
<br>
5. After filtration, we applied various techniques to check like thresholding, morphological operation etc.
<br>
6. On basis of calculation by applying discrete fusion and diffusion, we did various calculation and check tumor by operations.
<br>
7. To display, we applied outlines where tumor is detected and by removing the skull part and checking for more details in an image. 
<br>
8. Therefore, by applying data mining techniques and operation we have calculated if tumor exists or not
